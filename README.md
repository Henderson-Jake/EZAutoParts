# EZAutoParts
EZAutoParts is an ecommerce website for auto parts with the goal of making the search for auto parts easier and more user friendly. Most auto part websites are difficult to navigate especially if you have no idea what part you are looking for, our goal is to make finding auto parts online convenient for all users regardless of familiarity with vehicles. We plan on improving user experience by implementing an attractive and intuitive user interface as well as implementing a virtual assistant to help users find auto parts, resulting in a quicker, easier, and cheaper alternative in fixing/diagnosing your car rather than taking it to a shop.
